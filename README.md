BibleRose (In Development)
A multi-version Bible study tool inspired by the Rosetta Stone.
BibleRose uses Strongâ€™s Numbers and XML-based verse mapping to visualize word usage across different Bible translations. 
The name reflects the goal: unlocking language understanding through layered comparison

Currently it is a back-end project of python scripts that use pySword for some of the Bible modules
The main code starts in BR_Create_Main_Dictionary.py
